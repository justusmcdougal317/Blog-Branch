Mission for this application was to create a blog app this was done using handlebars.js and sequalize as the ORM and express. I created a main file for my project and called it app.js this is where all of my requyire statements and necessary routes where put. I made multple handlebar files to handle the structure of the page and neccesary components of the blog .I used javascript commands to make the buttons work and to be able to render each neccesary page to correspend with the buttons in navigation bar.
